Until 2010, the vast majority of the Indian population lacked any form of reliable formal identification. This posed a significant challenge for the government and the private sector in delivering essential services to the people, especially in rural areas. In 2010, the Indian government introduced the Aadhaar number, a unique identification number issued by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI). This marked a turning point in the country's digital transformation journey.

Aadhaar, which means "foundation,” is a 12-digit number that serves as an individual's biometric identity. It comprises an individual's biometric (fingerprints and iris scan) and demographic information, including their name, age, gender, and residential address. Aadhaar is the first layer of the India stack. It has enabled the government and private sector to improve efficiencies and innovate new products and services using Aadhaar.

Before Aadhaar, only one in 25 people had any form of formal identification, and just one in four had bank accounts. Aadhaar has transformed the authentication ecosystem in India and replaced multiple government IDs, such as passports, PAN cards, ration cards, and voter IDs, for authentication. Today, Aadhaar is ubiquitous: it provides easy and quick authentication to millions of Indians, helping to empower citizens.

The Indian government has been pushing for zero-balance bank accounts under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), opening over 450 million accounts by 2022. Aadhaar has been instrumental in achieving this goal, as it has facilitated the KYC process, reducing the cost of conducting e-KYC from $12 to 6 cents. This has helped extend banking to millions of Indians, improving financial inclusion and reducing corruption in government services access for the poor.

Aadhaar has facilitated the transfer of over $310 billion to more than 6 billion beneficiaries under direct benefit transfers by the government. This has been a significant achievement for India — it has enabled the government to deliver various social welfare schemes directly to the beneficiary’s bank accounts, cutting leakages and ensuring that the benefits reach the intended recipients.
